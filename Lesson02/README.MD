This lesson is focused on camera calibration and undistorting images. You will first use simulated images to learn 
how to estimate intrinsic parameters from a set of images. Then you will calibrate your own camera! After that
there will be demonstrations for how to remove lens distortion. You will validate the correctness by seeing if
a 3D point maps to the correct location.

Unlike the previous lesson this one only has a little bit of code. Look at the Exercise*.md instead of
going straight to the code.
