  * Lecture 3 "Camera Models II and Camera Calibration"

This lesson is focused on camera calibration. You will first use simulated images to learn how to estimate intrinsic
parameters from a set of images. Then you will calibrate your own camera!

Unlike the previous lesson this one only has a little bit of code. Look at the Exercise*.md instead of
going straight to the code.
