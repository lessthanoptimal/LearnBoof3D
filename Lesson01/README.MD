# Learn Pinhole Camera Model

BoofCV Demonstrations
* RenderSyntheticCamerModelApp

The goal of this exercise is to help you understand the pinhole camera model. To do that we will render
a point cloud and then change camera parameters and see how that changes thing. The RenderSyntheticCamerModelApp
let's you re-render an image after changing it's camera model. You should play with that first to
get an idea of what to expect.
