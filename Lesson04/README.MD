# Stereo Vision: Calibrated Cameras

In this lesson you will be introduced to the concepts of estimating the 3D structure of a scene from two images,
also known as stereo vision. The calibrated case we be discussed because it is much simpler than the uncalibrated
case. Calibration means that the transform between the two cameras is known and so are their intrinsic parameters.
If these are known then the image can be rectified and stereo processing because much easier.

You really need to go through the recommended reading for this lesson. A few terms used through out these exercises
are defined below:

baseline
rectification
epipolar lines
epipoles
disparity
triangulation
SAD
Correlation
